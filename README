Voxeo PRISM Sample Applications
================================================================================================

PRISM is a scalable Unified Communications Application Server for building and delivering web and 
telecom applications. PRISM is based on the latest IETF and Java open standards and supports SIP, 
XMPP (formerly Jabber), Jingle, HTTP, MRCP, MGCP, JSR-289, JSR-309, SIP/HTTP Servlets, 
J2EE architectures and XMPP Servlets. It includes Moho (open source Java framework for developing 
multi-channel communications applications), as well a standards based media server and clustering 
for high performance applications and a SIP/HTTP Servlet and Web Services runtime engine for 
converged IP communication service providers.
